My setup is below, this blueprint sets the status of the cover to the 5 different status open close opening closing stopped. Pretty simple, but it saves you a ton of time. Enter the sensor and enter the cover.

So, I gave up on MyQ, and implemented a Ratgdo solution. With EISY I’m using the Ratgdo Polyglot solution (By W. Randy King (Goose66)) to show my device status and control it via my main system, the EISY from Universal devices, and I have HA Yellow hardware.
I’m using the standard Universal Devices ISY/IoX integration. I used the HA documentation Universal Devices ISY/IoX https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/isy994/ - Home Assistant
to setup a cover within the EISY system that is pulled into HA.
